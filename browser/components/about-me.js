      <p>Thanks for stopping by! I'm Ross Lowry, a full-stack web developer with a passion for solving global challenges. You might call me a combination of 'do-gooder', tech nerd, and global adventurer. At the heart of it all is a desire to use technology to better the lives of others.</p><br/>
      <p>I'm experienced building web applications using the NERP (Node, Express, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, Sequelize) stack, among other libraries and tools. I look forward to learning many more!</p><br/>

      <p>Previously, I served as a project manager in Washington, DC for an international development contractor. This experience took me around world, giving me an appreciation for different cultures and ways of problem solving. My adventures across various countries and technical disciplines -- from sustainability, to local governance, to public health -- continued to reinforced a simple concept: digital technology holds considerable promise to address some of the most intractable social and economic challenges.</p><br/>

      <p>Whether at home or abroad, I'm eager to build new tools that are creative, innovative, and impactful!</p>
